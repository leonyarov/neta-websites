      <h1>architecture</h1>
    </strong></em>
  from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture">Wikipedia</a>
  <p>
    Architecture is the art and technique of designing and building,
    as distinguished from the skills associated with construction.
    It is both the process and the product of sketching, conceiving,
    planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other structures.
    The term comes from Latin architectura; from Ancient Greek
    ἀρχιτέκτων (arkhitéktōn) 'architect'; from ἀρχι- (arkhi-)
    'chief', and τέκτων (téktōn) 'creator'. Architectural works,
    in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as
    cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations
    are often identified with their surviving architectural
    achievements.
  </p>
  <p>
    The practice, which began in the prehistoric era, has been used as a
    way of expressing culture for civilizations on all seven continents
    . For this reason, architecture is considered to be a form of art.
    Texts on architecture have been written since ancient times.
    The earliest surviving text on architectural theories is the
    1st century AD treatise De architectura by the Roman architect
    Vitruvius, according to whom a good building embodies firmitas,
    utilitas, and venustas (durability, utility, and beauty).
    Centuries later, Leon Battista Alberti developed his ideas
    further, seeing beauty as an objective quality of buildings to
    be found in their proportions. Giorgio Vasari wrote Lives of
    the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects and
    put forward the idea of style in the Western arts in the
    16th century. In the 19th century, Louis Sullivan declared
    that "form follows function". "Function" began to replace
    the classical "utility" and was understood to include
    not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological
    and cultural dimensions. The idea of sustainable
    architecture was introduced in the late 20th century.

    Architecture began as rural, oral vernacular architecture that
    developed from trial and error to successful replication. Ancient
    urban architecture was preoccupied with building religious structures
    and buildings symbolizing the political power of rulers until Greek
    and Roman architecture shifted focus to civic virtues. Indian and
    Chinese architecture influenced forms all over Asia and Buddhist
    architecture in particular took diverse local flavors. In fact,
    During the European Middle Ages, pan-European styles of
    Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals and abbeys emerged while the
    Renaissance favored Classical forms implemented by architects
    known by name. Later, the roles of architects and engineers
    became separated. Modern architecture began after World War
    I as an avant-garde movement that sought to develop a
    completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social
    and economic order focused on meeting the needs of the
    middle and working classes. Emphasis was put on modern
    techniques, materials, and simplified geometric forms,
    paving the way for high-rise superstructures. Many
    architects became disillusioned with modernism which
    they perceived as ahistorical and anti-aesthetic, and
    postmodern and contemporary architecture developed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, the field of architectural construction has branched
    out to include everything from ship design to interior decorating.
  </p>
  <em><h2>Historic treatises</h2></em>
  <p>
    The earliest surviving written work on the subject of architecture is
    De architectura by the Roman architect Vitruvius in the early 1st
    century AD.[12] According to Vitruvius, a good building should s
    atisfy the three principles of firmitas, utilitas, venustas,
    commonly known by the original translation – firmness, commodity
    and delight. An equivalent in modern English would be:
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>Durability – a building should stand up robustly and remain in good condition</li>
    <li>Utility – it should be suitable for the purposes for which it is used</li>
    <li>Beauty – it should be aesthetically pleasing</li>
  </p>

    width="270" height="230" />
  <p>
    According to Vitruvius, the architect should strive to fulfill each of
    these three attributes as well as possible. Leon Battista Alberti,
    who elaborates on the ideas of Vitruvius in his treatise, De re
    aedificatoria, saw beauty primarily as a matter of proportion,
    although ornament also played a part. For Alberti, the rules of
    proportion were those that governed the idealized human figure, the
    Golden mean. The most important aspect of beauty was, therefore, an
    inherent part of an object, rather than something applied
    superficially, and was based on universal, recognizable truths.
    The notion of style in the arts was not developed until the 16th
    century, with the writing of Giorgio Vasari.[15] By the 18th century,
    his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects
    had been translated into Italian, French, Spanish, and English.
    In the 16th century, Italian Mannerist architect, painter and theorist
    Sebastiano Serlio wrote Tutte L'Opere D'Architettura et Prospetiva
    (Complete Works on Architecture and Perspective). This treatise
    exerted immense influence throughout Europe, being the first handbook
    that emphasized the practical rather than the theoretical aspects of
    architecture, and it was the first to catalog the five orders.
  </p>
  <p>
    in the early 19th century, Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin wrote
    Contrasts (1836) that, as the title suggested, contrasted the modern,
    industrial world, which he disparaged, with an idealized image of
    neo-medieval world. Gothic architecture, Pugin believed, was the only
    "true Christian form of architecture." The 19th-century English
    art critic, John Ruskin, in his Seven Lamps of Architecture,
    published 1849, was much narrower in his view of what constituted
    architecture. Architecture was the "art which so disposes and adorns
    the edifices raised by men … that the sight of them" contributes "to
    his mental health, power, and pleasure". For Ruskin, the aesthetic
    was of overriding significance. His work goes on to state that a
    building is not truly a work of architecture unless it is in some way
    "adorned". For Ruskin, a well-constructed, well-proportioned,
    functional building needed string courses or rustication, at the
    very least.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the difference between the ideals of architecture and mere
    construction, the renowned 20th-century architect Le Corbusier wrote:
    "You employ stone, wood, and concrete, and with these materials you
    build houses and palaces: that is construction. Ingenuity is at work.
    But suddenly you touch my heart, you do me good. I am happy and I say:
    This is beautiful. That is Architecture". Le Corbusier's
    contemporary Ludwig Mies van der Rohe said "Architecture starts
    when you carefully put two bricks together. There it begins."
  </p>
  <em><strong>Modern concepts</strong></em>
  <p>
    The notable 19th-century architect of skyscrapers, Louis Sullivan,
    promoted an overriding precept to architectural design: "Form follows
    function". While the notion that structural and aesthetic
    considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met
    with both popularity and skepticism, it had the effect of introducing
    the concept of "function" in place of Vitruvius' "utility". "Function"
    came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use, perception
    and enjoyment of a building, not only practical but also aesthetic,
    psychological and cultural.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nunzia Rondanini stated, "Through its aesthetic dimension architecture
    goes beyond the functional aspects that it has in common with other
    human sciences. Through its own particular way of expressing values,
    architecture can stimulate and influence social life without presuming
    that, in and of itself, it will promote social development....
    To restrict the meaning of (architectural) formalism to art for art's sake is not only reactionary; it can also be a
    purposeless quest for perfection or originality which degrades form into a mere instrumentality"
  </p>

  <p>
    Among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their
    approach to building design are Rationalism, Empiricism,
    Structuralism, Poststructuralism, Deconstruction and Phenomenology.
    In the late 20th century a new concept was added to those included in
    the compass of both structure and function, the consideration of
    sustainability, hence sustainable architecture. To satisfy the
    contemporary ethos a building should be constructed in a manner which
    is environmentally friendly in terms of the production of its
    materials, its impact upon the natural and built environment of its
    surrounding area and the demands that it makes upon non-sustainable
    power sources for heating, cooling, water and waste management, and
    lighting.

  <p>
    Building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs (shelter, security, worship, etc.) and means
    (available building materials and attendant skills). As human cultures developed and knowledge began
    to be formalized through oral traditions and practices, building became a craft, and "architecture"
    is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft. It is widely
    assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error, with progressively
    less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory.
    What is termed vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world.

  Early human settlements were mostly rural. Hence, Expending economies resulted in the creation of urban areas which in some cases grew and evolved very rapidly, such as that of Çatal Höyük in Anatolia and Mohenjo Daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in modern-day Pakistan.

Neolithic settlements and "cities" include Göbekli Tepe and Çatalhöyük in 
Turkey, Jericho in the Levant, Mehrgarh in Pakistan, Knap of Howar and 
Skara Brae, Orkney Islands, Scotland, and the Cucuteni-Trypillian 
culture settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine.

<p>
In many ancient civilizations such as those of Egypt and Mesopotamia, 
architecture and urbanism reflected the constant engagement with the 
divine and the supernatural, and many ancient cultures resorted to 
monumentality in architecture to symbolically represent the political 
power of the ruler or the state itself.
<br>
The architecture and urbanism of the Classical civilizations such as the 
Greek and the Roman evolved from civic ideals rather than religious or 
empirical ones and new building types emerged. As the Architectural 
"style" developed in the form of the Classical orders. Roman architecture 
was influenced by Greek architecture as they incorporated many Greek 
elements into their building practices.
<br>
Texts on architecture have been written since ancient times. These texts 
provided both general advice and specific formal prescriptions or canons. 
Some examples of canons are found in the writings of the 1st-century BCE 
Roman Architect Vitruvius. Some of the most important early examples of 
canonic architecture are religious.

<p>
he architecture of different parts of Asia developed differently than 
Europe; and each of Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh architecture had different 
characteristics. In fact, Unlike Indian and Chinese architecture which 
had great influence on the surrounding regions, Japanese architecture did 
not. Some Asian architecture showed great regional diversity such as 
Buddhist architecture, in particular. Moreover, other architectural 
achievements in Asia is the Hindu temple architecture, which developed 
from around the 5th century CE, is in theory governed by concepts laid 
down in the Shastras, and is concerned with expressing the macrocosm and 
the microcosm.

<p>
In many Asian countries, pantheistic religion led to architectural forms 
that were designed specifically to enhance the natural landscape. Also, 
the grandest houses were relatively lightweight structures mainly using 
wood until recent times, and there are few survivals of great age. 
Buddhism was associated with a move to stone and brick religious 
structures, probably beginning as rock-cut architecture, which has often 
survived very well.
</p>
<P>
Early Asian writings on architecture include the Kao Gong Ji of China 
from the 7th–5th centuries BCE; the Shilpa Shastras of ancient India; 
Manjusri Vasthu Vidya Sastra of Sri Lanka and Araniko of Nepal .

<em><strong>Islamic architecture</strong></em>

<p>
Islamic architecture began in the 7th century CE, incorporating 
architectural forms from the ancient Middle East and Byzantium, 
but also developing features to suit the religious and social needs of 
the society. Examples can be found throughout the Middle East, Turkey, 
North Africa, the Indian Sub-continent and in parts of Europe, such as 
Spain, Albania, and the Balkan States, as the result of the expansion 
of the Ottoman Empire.

<em><strong>Renaissance and the architect</strong></em>

<p>
In Renaissance Europe, from about 1400 onwards, there was a revival of
 Classical learning accompanied by the development of Renaissance 
 humanism, which placed greater emphasis on the role of the 
 individual in society than had been the case during the Medieval 
 period. Buildings were ascribed to specific architects – 
 Brunelleschi, Alberti, Michelangelo, Palladio – and the cult of the 
 individual had begun. There was still no dividing line between 
 artist, architect and engineer, or any of the related vocations, 
 and the appellation was often one of regional preference.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Le_salon_des_Perspectives_%28Villa_Farnesina%2C_Rome%29_%2834242676046%29.jpg/1280px-Le_salon_des_Perspectives_%28Villa_Farnesina%2C_Rome%29_%2834242676046%29.jpg"
width="270" height="230" >
</p>
<p>
A revival of the Classical style in architecture was accompanied by a 
burgeoning of science and engineering, which affected the proportions 
and structure of buildings. At this stage, it was still possible for 
an artist to design a bridge as the level of structural calculations 
involved was within the scope of the generalist.
</p>
<em><strong>Architecture today</strong></em>
<p>
Since the 1980s, as the complexity of buildings began to increase 
(in terms of structural systems, services, energy and technologies), 
the field of architecture became multi-disciplinary with 
specializations for each project type, technological expertise or 
project delivery methods. Moreover, there has been an increased 
separation of the 'design' architect [Notes 1] from the 'project' 
architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards 
and deals with matters of liability.[Notes 2] The preparatory 
processes for the design of any large building have become 
increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such 
matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and 
compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the 
design of one person but must be the work of many. Modernism and 
Postmodernism have been criticized by some members of the 
architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not 
a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; 
rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology
 to create livable environments, with the design process being 
 informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social 
 sciences
</p>

width="270" height="230">
</p>
<p>
Environmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue, with a 
profound effect on the architectural profession. Many developers, 
those who support the financing of buildings, have become educated to 
encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design, 
rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost. Major 
examples of this can be found in passive solar building design, 
greener roof designs, biodegradable materials, and more attention 
to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has 
also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. 
There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings that seek 
to meet green building sustainable design principles. Sustainable 
practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture 
increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially 
ustainable contemporary techniques. The U.S. Green Building 
Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) 
rating system has been instrumental in this.
</p>
<p>
Concurrently, the recent movements of New Urbanism, 
Metaphoric architecture, Complementary architecture and New 
Classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards 
construction that appreciates and develops smart growth, 
architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to 
modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as leaning 
against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Glass 
curtain walls, which were the hallmark of the ultra modern urban 
life in many countries surfaced even in developing countries like 
Nigeria where international styles had been represented since the 
mid 20th Century mostly because of the leanings of foreign-trained 
architects.
