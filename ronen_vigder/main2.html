<em><strong>some things you need to know</strong></em>
<li>Modernism: Modernism is both a philosophical and arts movement 
    that arose from broad transformations in Western society during 
    the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The movement reflected a 
    desire for the creation of new forms of art, philosophy, and 
    social organization which reflected the newly emerging 
    industrial world, including features such as urbanization, 
    architecture, new technologies, and war. Artists attempted to 
    depart from traditional forms of art, which they considered 
    outdated or obsolete. The poet Ezra Pound's 1934 injunction to 
    "Make it New" was the touchstone of the movement's approach.</li>
    <br>
<li>Postmodernism: Postmodernism is an intellectual stance or mode of 
    discourse characterized by skepticism toward the "grand 
    narratives" of modernism, opposition to epistemic certainty or 
    stability of meaning, and emphasis on ideology as a means of 
    maintaining political power.Claims to objective fact are 
    dismissed as na√Øve realism, with attention drawn to the 
    conditional nature of knowledge claims within particular 
    historical, political, and cultural discourses. The postmodern 
    outlook is characterized by self-referentiality, epistemological 
    relativism, moral relativism, pluralism, irony, irreverence, and 
    eclecticism; it rejects the "universal validity" of binary 
    oppositions, stable identity, hierarchy, and categorization. </li>
<br>
<li>Seismic architecture: The term 'seismic architecture' or 
    'earthquake architecture' was first introduced in 1985 by Robert 
    Reitherman. The phrase "earthquake architecture" is used to 
    describe a degree of architectural expression of earthquake 
    resistance or implication of architectural configuration, form or 
    style in earthquake resistance. It is also used to describe 
     buildings in which seismic design considerations impacted its 
     architecture. It may be considered a new aesthetic approach in 
     designing structures in seismic prone areas. The wide breadth of 
     expressive possibilities ranges from metaphorical uses of 
     seismic issues, to the more straightforward exposure of seismic
      technology. While outcomes of an earthquake architecture can be 
      very diverse in their physical manifestations, architectural 
      expression of seismic principles can also take many forms and 
      levels of sophistication.</li>
